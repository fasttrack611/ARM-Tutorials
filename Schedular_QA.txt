Over time, it has evolved into the **Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)**, the default scheduler for non-real-time tasks. Below is a detailed breakdown of its operation:

---

### **1. Overview of Scheduling in Linux**
Linux uses a **hierarchy of scheduler classes** to handle different types of tasks:
- **Real-Time (RT) Schedulers**: For time-critical tasks (e.g., `SCHED_FIFO`, `SCHED_RR`).
- **Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)**: For regular processes (default for most tasks).
- **Idle Scheduler**: Runs when no other tasks are available.

The scheduler prioritizes real-time tasks over CFS tasks, ensuring low-latency responses.

---

### **2. Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)**
CFS aims to provide **fair CPU time** to all runnable processes. Key concepts include:

#### **a. Virtual Runtime (vruntime)**
- Each task has a `vruntime` value, which tracks how much CPU time it has **virtually** used, adjusted by its priority.
- Lower-priority tasks (higher `nice` values) accumulate `vruntime` faster, reducing their CPU share.
- CFS selects the task with the **smallest `vruntime`** to run next.

#### **b. Red-Black Tree (RB Tree)**
- CFS uses a **self-balancing red-black tree** to organize runnable tasks sorted by `vruntime`.
- The leftmost node (smallest `vruntime`) is picked next.
- Tasks are inserted/removed in **O(log N)** time, ensuring efficiency.

#### **c. Time Slicing and Scheduling Latency**
- **Scheduling latency**: Target period (`sched_latency_ns`) during which all runnable tasks should run at least once.
- **Time slice**: Each task gets `sched_latency_ns / N` time, where `N` is the number of runnable tasks.
- Interactive tasks (e.g., GUI apps) benefit because their frequent sleeps reset their `vruntime`, giving them priority when they wake.

#### **d. Priority and Weight**
- Priorities are mapped to **weights** (derived from `nice` values). Lower `nice` values (higher priority) have higher weights.
- `vruntime` is updated as:
  ```
  vruntime += (actual_runtime * NICE_0_LOAD) / task_weight
  ```
  Higher-weight tasks accumulate `vruntime` slower, receiving more CPU time.

---

### **3. Real-Time (RT) Schedulers**
Real-time tasks have strict timing requirements and use two policies:
- **`SCHED_FIFO`**: Tasks run until they yield or are preempted by a higher-priority task.
- **`SCHED_RR`**: Similar to FIFO but with **round-robin time slicing** for tasks of the same priority.

RT tasks are managed in a priority-sorted linked list and always preempt CFS tasks.

---

### **4. Key Data Structures**
- **Runqueue**: Each CPU core has its own runqueue (for both CFS and RT tasks).
  - CFS uses a red-black tree for `vruntime` ordering.
  - RT uses a priority-sorted list.
- **Task Struct**: Each process (`task_struct`) contains scheduling parameters (e.g., `vruntime`, priority, policy).

---

### **5. Context Switching**
- The scheduler is invoked via:
  - **Timer interrupts** (scheduler tick, typically 1ms–10ms).
  - **Voluntary yields** (e.g., I/O waits, system calls).
- `schedule()` is the core function that selects the next task and performs a context switch:
  - Saves the current task’s state.
  - Loads the next task’s state.

---

### **6. Load Balancing**
To optimize multicore systems:
- **Per-CPU Runqueues**: Avoid lock contention by keeping separate queues for each core.
- **Load Balancing**: Periodically redistributes tasks across cores to prevent imbalance.
  - **Push Migration**: Overloaded CPUs push tasks to idle cores.
  - **Pull Migration**: Idle cores steal tasks from busy ones.

---

### **7. Preemption**
- **Kernel Preemption**: Allows higher-priority tasks to interrupt the kernel (enabled via `CONFIG_PREEMPT`).
- **Tickless Kernel**: Reduces unnecessary interrupts in idle states to save power.

---

### **8. Advanced Features**
- **Group Scheduling**: Uses `cgroups` to allocate CPU time hierarchically (e.g., limiting a user’s processes).
- **NUMA Awareness**: Optimizes task placement for memory locality in multi-socket systems.
- **Energy-Aware Scheduling (EAS)**: On ARM/embedded systems, balances performance and power efficiency.

---

### **9. Example Workflow**
1. A timer interrupt triggers the scheduler.
2. The kernel checks if the current task’s time slice is exhausted or if a higher-priority task is ready.
3. CFS selects the leftmost task from the red-black tree (smallest `vruntime`).
4. If real-time tasks exist, they are scheduled first.
5. A context switch occurs, transferring control to the new task.

---

### **10. Summary**
- **CFS** ensures fairness by tracking `vruntime` and using a red-black tree.
- **Real-Time Schedulers** prioritize time-critical tasks.
- **Load Balancing** and **Preemption** optimize multicore performance and responsiveness.
- Advanced features like `cgroups` and NUMA support cater to complex workloads.

The Linux scheduler balances efficiency, fairness, and responsiveness, adapting dynamically to system load and task behavior.
